# Most-Commonly-Used-Function-In-Data-Science

In this notebook, we will explore some of the most commonly used functions in machine learning projects with Google format.

In this format, the docstring starts with a short summary of the function, followed by a more detailed description of the parameters and return values, if any.

This format allows for easier readability and understandability of the code and its purpose.

It's also easier to navigate and understand the code when you are working with other people on the same project.

These functions will cover topics such as data preprocessing{ feature scaling, features selection, features importance}, model evaluation.

The Notebook will be constantly updated and provided with more functions.
